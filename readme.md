This project aims to illustrate sketches of Manga Characters.
The training set has sketches and their respective colored counterparts.
The Pix2Pix architecture is applied here but the discriminator loss is based on the WGAN GP loss
The hope is that WGAN GP introduces stability in the training of the model and the sample generation looks as close to the train set as possible
Future scope of the project includes fine-tuning to specific manga characters
A future goal is to train the model to apply image to image translation to whole scenes
